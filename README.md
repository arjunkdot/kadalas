Kadalas (കടലാസ്) /kəɖəlaːs/ is a minimalist, yet colorful theme primarily designed and built for Zed. 
This started out as I was looking for a theme that suits my taste but couldn\'t find one.
The project is still in beta, and some colors might be missing as of now. 
But I\'m constantly working and fine-tuning the theme to make it complete. Right now, only available for Zed. Available in both light and dark mode.
